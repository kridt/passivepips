💰 Curious about how much money you really need to dive into PAMM investing? You're not alone! Many aspiring investors wonder if they have enough to get started. 

PAMM (Percentage Allocation Management Module) trading allows you to pool your funds with experienced traders, which means you don’t need to have a fortune to begin. The minimum deposit for PAMM accounts can vary depending on the broker, but it often starts as low as $100! This makes it accessible for those who want to test the waters without risking a large sum. 

Even with a small investment, you can leverage the expertise of professional traders and potentially see returns from your capital. The key is to choose a PAMM manager who aligns with your financial goals and risk tolerance. 

So, whether you're a complete beginner or looking to diversify your income streams, PAMM trading offers a fantastic opportunity for passive forex income.
